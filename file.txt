1 Data Preparation:
Combine the relevant datasets, including user information, channel information, and interaction data (subscription data).
Preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, location, genre), and create user-item interaction matrices.
2.Split Data:
Split the dataset into a training set and a test set to evaluate the model's performance.
3.Model Training
Train the chosen model on the training data, using appropriate loss functions and optimization techniques.
4. Prediction:
Use the trained model to make predictions for each user, suggesting the top channels they are likely to subscribe to in the future.
5. Model Selection SVD (Singular Value Decomposition): SVD is a matrix factorization technique used in collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems. It decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into three matrices: U (user factors), Î£ (singular values), and V^T (item factors). These matrices capture latent features that represent users and items in a lower-dimensional space. The model predicts user-item interactions based on the dot product of these factors.
- We load the user-item interaction data from CSV files.
- We create a Surprise Dataset object using the data.
- We split the data into training and testing sets.
- We train SVD-based models for different types of user interactions (subscribe, comment, account, likes).
- We make predictions for unseen interactions based on the trained models.

1. Frotend Enhancement
 Applying style and design improve Graphical user interface and make it more user friendly so that he can easily used it

Next Period
1 Feedback Loop:Implement mechanisms for collecting user feedback on the recommendations and use this feedback to continually improve the recommendation model.
2 Deployment:Deploy the recommendation system in your application, website, or platform.
